    <h3> Machine Learning Engineer (R&D Team) | <a href="https://kensho.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Kensho</a> | 2017-07 to 2021-07 </h3>

    Making geopolitical structured data and news streams useful in machine learning tasks.

    <ul>
        <li>Joined DC office as second ML engineer and eleventh employee as the office explored products aimed at
        geopolitical news analysts</li>
        <li>Participated in product road mapping, hiring, customer pitches, rapid prototyping, and research on extracting
        structured information from text</li>

        <li>Rapid prototyping for weakly supervised text classification. Experimented with zero-shot natural language
        inference / textual entailment and sentence transformers. Applied positive and unlabeled (PU) + confident
        learning (CL) techniques to data with noisy labels.</li>
        <li>Researched, planned, and developed initial version of Kensho's Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation
        (NERD) technology that maps mentions of named entities in text to knowledge base (KB) entries (mention
        extraction, co-referencing, candidate generation, feature generation, KB entry prediction)</li>
        <li>Lead instructor for internal education group teaching transformer networks to Kensho employees.</li>

        <li>Kensho lead on Wikimedia for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Developed a pipeline that synthesizes a
        consistent machine readable NLP dataset from raw Wikipedia and Wikidata dumps.</li>
        <li>Applied Wikimedia dataset to R&D tasks such as synonym generation, word sense disambiguation, combining word
        and graph embeddings, custom topical corpus generation, and NER data augmentation.</li>

        <li>Topological data analysis for text. Used the mapper algorithm (lens, cover, pull back, cluster) to produce
        compact graph-based representations of large corpora.</li>
        <li>Designed semantic corpus search (e.g., search using keywords, concepts, entities, or entire documents).</li>
